Java 8 meta space : 

From Java 8 PermGen was replaced by a new memory area called Metaspace. 
It has the same role as PermGen which is to store class metadata. 
Metaspace is not part of the JVM heap, but is allocated in native operating system memory. 
It can auto-increase as needed to load additional class metadata.
