Singleton class :
A class which has only one instance created in heap memory.

There should be no other way to create another instance of that class.

	class Employee{
		private Employee(){} // 1. private default constructor

		private static volatile Employee object = null; // 2. static volatile object initialized to null.
	   
		public static Employee instance(){ // 3. Static method which return Employee object.
			
			if(object == null){ // 4. Create a new object if the object is not already created and return the object.
			
				synchronized(Employee.class){ // 5. Double Checked locking Pattern : checking null condition above and below synchronized method.
					
					if(object == null){ // 6. Create a new object if the object is not already created and return the object.
						object = new Employee();
					}
				}
			}
			
			return object;
	   }
